NOTE: This app is still in development. There are probably many errors.

This code creates a game where the player navigates through a jungle, avoiding monsters and obstacles, collecting treasure and items, and trying to find the exit.
The game is updated based on the player's actions, and the current state of the game is displayed on the screen.
Please note that this is a basic implementation and can be improved and expanded upon. You can add more features, such as scoring, multiple levels, and more complex game mechanics.
Also, you can adjust the difficulty level by changing the probabilities in the generateJungle method.
You can test the game by opening the index.html file in a web browser.
